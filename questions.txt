Create airflow job to:
Pull structured data from an online data source (stock data is pretty easy to get, could also do sports or travel information)
    - to accomplish this, use API to retrieve data (yahoo finance API?)
    - so Apache Airflow is like CronJobs on steroids?
Write the data to an S3 bucket
    - S3 is the data lake
